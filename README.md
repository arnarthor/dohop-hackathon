Dohop hackathon project
===
## The Team:
	- Arnar Þór Sveinsson
	- Axel Máni Gíslason

===
## About
	We created a solution allowing users to create a tour around the world 
	combining factors like price, travel time and distance.
	This basically means combining Dohop and Kilroy into one.
	
	It is extremely cool because you can see your trip being made live 
	on the map, see how it changes to watch what is happening. 
	When it is ready you can drop into street view and see the city 
	you are about to visit, see tourist attraction and even book hotels! 
===
## How to run
	We recommend you check the solution out at  ....

	If you want you can clone the project and follow these instruction

	Make sure you have mongodb installed before trying to run this.

	```
	make bootstrap
	make run-sever // In one terminal
	make run // In another terminal
	```

	Once selected you can click create journey to begin your adventure. 
	You will see our backend trying to create the best trip for you live and 
	displaying it for you on the map.
![Generating trips](img/generating.png "Our server generates trips for you")

	When ready you can see all the places you are going to via the sidebar on the right. 
	You can also see tourist attraction, drop into streetview and book hotels for each place
	and of course the total price.

## Why is it cool
	There isn't any solution out there that creates a tours like ours. 
	It takes many factors into consideration, length and other factors
	and creates trips and information about places to go to. The fact that you can drop in, see tourist attraction and book the hotels makes it even so more cooler !
